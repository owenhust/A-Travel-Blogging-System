#Features including:
A. The home page, or the main page, presents couple of items (Fig. 3):
1.	RandoMOS logo;
2.	Navbar items including Home, Login/Logout, Browse your posts, creating new posts, searching and Admin Page;
3.	Post sorting by name, title and date;
4.	All the posts listed from latest to oldest by default; your posts when Browse Your Posts is clicked. 

B.	Profile /Edit Profile
The Profile page shows the icons with options of either choosing from library or uploading other icons. The basic user information is displayed on this page, with buttons linking to Home, Edit Profile, where you can edit basic information except user name and email, and Delete Account. 

C.	Post
The Post page is intended to show the post content and for user to carry out any activities related to posts, comments and replies. Users can create new posts, edit or delete their own posts. Also, users can do nested comments, meaning leaving comments, or replies on others’ comments and replies, and delete their own comments or replies.

D.	Create Post/Edit Post
Both the Create Post and Edit Post features are implemented by Bootstrap modal techniques with WYSIWYG feature instead of creating new web pages. This is believed to be much more user-friendly than separate web pages. Basically, the Create Post and Edit Post are based on the same design, except that the Edit Post can the existing post content and present it when the edit modal is called.  

E.	Registration Page
The Registration Page allows user to register by putting in general info such as username, first name, last name, birthday, etc. Meanwhile this page automatically checks if any user name already exists or not while you enter your user name. Also, it gives warning when your password does not match confirmation password. 

F.	Login Page
The Login Page allows user to log in by inputting user name and password. Also, it asks user to go through reCaptcha identification provided by Google . It will return alerting messages if user name does not exist or user name and password do not match. 

G.	Administrator Page
The Administrator Page allows a logged in administrator to do two tasks:
•	Batch add accounts following the specified format;
•	Delete user accounts.
