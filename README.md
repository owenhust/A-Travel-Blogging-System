# A-Travel-Blogging-System
This is a blogging system I participated and led for my PGCert in IT programme at University of Auckland
- I carried out the skills of web programming including Javascript, SQL, ajax, JSON, and OOP Java for scriptlets. 
- I also led the pair programming, slack updates, stand-up meeting, merges management and the project team tasks.  
- with this project I gained both A+ in Java and Web programming papers (each 60 points).
